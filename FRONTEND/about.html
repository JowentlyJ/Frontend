        <p>Hi there my name is Jowently Josephina. You may think this is my portfolio but no it isn’t. I’m 22 years old. I’m currently in my fourth and last year of communication multimedia & Design. This website is just so I can practice my coding which I’m very bad in coding stuff. My problem is that I understand it but writing it from scratch. But that’s alright because I’m taking classes for coding. The main content of this website will be photography. Since a couple of months ago I bought my self a camera. A Nikon D5300 with 2 lenses it was more of an investment and something new. I never and still didn’t take any kind of classes of photography so I had to do my own research. It all started from thinking of buying a GoPro to buy a DSLR camera. You may wonder why I bought Nikon and no other brands of DSLR. A friend of mine showed me a couple of pictures he took in and I was impressed. After that I started doing research on different brands features all that geek stuff. For my budget that I had the Nikon suits it the best meanwhile my mother wanted me to wait do more research. I say YOLO mom. Nearly forgot about my cousin so she also moved from curacao to here so I told her I will guide her so she is not alone in this big world. The plan was to meet my cousin and she would buy her stuffs. While she is searching I was looking to the DSLR’s and so I grabbed the one I wanted and I bought it and then I said YOLO and bye bye all the money. When I got home I immediately unbox the thing and open my laptop and browse YouTube so I can get any type of information about how to use this camera. I watched a couple of tutorials and tips and trick then I started to shoot everything it didn’t matter what bikes bucket flowers people outside anything. Oh, this was inside my room because I was kind of afraid to walk with a camera not knowing what to capture.
